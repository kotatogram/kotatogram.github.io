But since there is a huge leap from last source update, some things could break, so it&amp;rsquo;s the beta again to make minimal needed tests. If there will no bugs, or they will be easy to fix, this version will be quickly promoted to steable. But this version also has few new features with fixes.</description></item><item><title>Kotatogram 1.4.3 beta released!</title><link>https://kotatogram.github.io/blog/release-1-4-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 22:16:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://kotatogram.github.io/blog/release-1-4-3/</guid><description>This update is pretty small in features, but it contains some internal work with versioning and updates that allows fasters rebuilds.

It featured old releases, old feature list&amp;hellip; and that&amp;rsquo;s it. It was pretty much a placeholder, than something useful.
But I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to give it a new look and content. So, welcome to the new site.
Instead of Jekyll, used in GitHub Pages by default, I decided to go with Hugo and modified port of HTML5UP&amp;rsquo;s Alpha theme. See the source code if you want to fit it for yourself.</description></item></channel></rss>
