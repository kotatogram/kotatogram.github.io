It featured old releases, old feature list&amp;hellip; and that&amp;rsquo;s it. It was pretty much a placeholder, than something useful.
But I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to give it a new look and content. So, welcome to the new site.
Instead of Jekyll, used in GitHub Pages by default, I decided to go with Hugo and modified port of HTML5UP&amp;rsquo;s Alpha theme. See the source code if you want to fit it for yourself.</description></item><item><title>Download Kotatogram Desktop</title><link>https://kotatogram.github.io/download/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kotatogram.github.io/download/</guid><description>Stable version Latest is 1.4 (based on Telegram Desktop 2.7.1) Windows Supports Windows 7 and higher. 32-bit installer 32-bit portable 64-bit installer 64-bit portable Linux Supports Ubuntu 16.04 and higher.

What are the test versions? Will they have auto-updates? Can I use my existing Kotatogram Desktop profile? How to report a bug in test version? How to disable debug logs? Where to download test version? What are the test versions? Test versions are experimental pre-release versions of Kotatogram Desktop. They needed to test specific changes that can be possibly made in Kotatogram Desktop.
Keep in mind that all changes in the test versions are not final and there is no guarantee that they will be made in Kotatogram stable branch.</description></item></channel></rss>
